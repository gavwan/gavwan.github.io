            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>Scenario… You’ve purchased a new iPhone 12, you’re all excited and unbox it to find out you’re MISSING A CHARGER! You check online and Apple are charging you £19.99 on top just to charge your phone with the included cable? Look no further as we check out Aukey’s much cheaper option to charge your iPhone at full 20W!</p>
            <img id="mobile-img" src="post-00010(1).jpg" alt="Aukey Omnia USB-C 20W Charger Rear">

            <h4>Why did we purchase this?</h4>
            <img id="desktop-img" src="post-00010(1).jpg" alt="Aukey Omnia USB-C 20W Charger Rear">
            <p>We purchased this for under £7 from Amazon and is marketed as a 20W charger made for iPhones. Buying a new iPhone can be quite costly, ranging from their cheapest at £699 iPhone 12 mini to £1099 for the iPhone 12 Pro Max. At this price, you would assume you can use the phone straight out of the box. However, due to Apple claiming that removing the power brick will reduce carbon emissions. On average, this change would eliminate 2 million metric tons of carbon emissions per year and most people would already have a charger laying around or use their previous generation one.</p>
            <p>In previous years, Apple provided 5W with their iPhones for many years (except for last years Pro line which included a 18W fast charger and USB-C to Lightning cable inside the box) and the provided cable of the 2020 “12” series all come with a USB-C to Lightning cable with won’t work with the older 5W chargers as they are USB-A. So you’ll need to purchase a new 20W charger to be able to use the cable and charge at faster speeds.</p>
            <h4>What’s in the Box?</h4>
            <p>The supplied box is made from cardboard and is petite in size. Inside the box includes the white plug, user manual for precautions and AUKEYCARE card with allows you to get an extra 6 months warranty (customer service emails with different languages in on the same card. There is also a chance to win Au-Kit if you create videos/photos and share them online as a brand promotion, there is also a small removable sticker on the back side. There is some nice cut out cardboard designed for the charger to allow it to fit snug in the box.</p>

            <h4>Supported devices</h4>
            <img id="desktop-img" src="post-00010(2).jpg" alt="Charger Plugged in">
            <p>There is only 1 output which is USB-C, that supports Power Delivery (PD) and Quick Charge 2.0 for a wide range of Android devices such as the Google Pixel line, iPads and can be used to charge the Nintendo Switch too.</p>
            <p>This device charges with 5V/3A ~ 9V/2.22A (20W Power Delivery 3.0) ~ 12V/1.67A compared to other similar chargers that do a maximum of 9V.</p>
            <img id="mobile-img" src="post-00010(2).jpg" alt="Charger Plugged in">

            <h4>Design</h4>
            <p>The plug comes in an all white design with the logo “AUKEY” engraved into the centre of the product, it’s not noticeable with distance but it’s there if you touch the top of the plug. The matte plastic is great to hide fingerprints compared to a glossy finish.</p>
            <p>The overall charger is very small and compact.</p>
            <p>The 3 pins are not foldable and are stationary.</p>
            <p>The exact measurements of this charger is 50.5mm x 50.5mm x 24.6mm, weighing in only at 59 grams.</p>

            <h4>Issues</h4>
            <img id="desktop-img" src="post-00010(3).jpg" alt="Aukey Omnia USB-C 20W Charger Front">
            <p>One of the main issues of this plug is the lack of folding legs. That’s why the Apple 18W/20W chargers are great as the legs fold into the base of the body whilst maintain a small footprint. This can be helpful for travelling or placing the charging in your pocket. The Aukey charger is awkward in the regard as the 3 pins.</p>
            <p>The USA version of this exact charger comes at a much smaller footprint.</p>
            <p>Even though it will charge a Nintendo Switch, it won’t charge the Switch at full speed. This is because the Switch can charge at 15V/2.6A (39W) max under USB-C Power Delivery 2.0.</p>
            <img id="mobile-img" src="post-00010(3).jpg" alt="Aukey Omnia USB-C 20W Charger Front">

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>If you don’t already have a 20W capable charger laying around and you’ve just purchased an iPhone 12, this product is great to compliment the phone. Charging at 20W allows 50% charge in 30 minutes is great if you need some juice just before you head out. However as new mobiles such as Xiao Mi, OnePlus and Oppo, they have chargers that reach above 65W for their mobile phones. This is not future proof as iPhones may increase the accepted wattage to be higher 1 or 2 generations down the line. If you have other devices such as the iPad Pros, this charger will charge faster than the included 18W charger (2020 series).</p>
            <p>At a price point of £7, its not a bad purchase and works great without overheating. Its small and portable, perfect for throwing it in your bag if you need a quick charger at the local coffee shop.</p>
