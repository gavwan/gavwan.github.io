          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>With new devices now supporting USB-C and removing standard/mini HDMI ports, you’ll need a dongle or adapter to extend your monitor, share you tablet or mobile device on the big screen! Here we have a relatively cheap adapter from Syntech! Let’s check it out!</p>

          <h4>Why did we purchase this?</h4>
          <img src="post-00006(1).jpg" alt="USB-C to HDMI adapter">
          <p>I purchased this product as I wanted to extend my MacBook Display to a larger monitor. This helps with working at home with more screen real estate as the small 13” can be hard to see at times. I headed to Amazon UK and found this Syntech Adapter for around £10.</p>

          <h4>What’s in the Box?</h4>
          <p>The adapter came inside a small paper box with some paperwork regarding warranty and if you’re happy with the product. Nothing special but this is as easy as plugging and it works. No extra setting up required.</p>

          <h4>Supported devices</h4>
          <p>Standard newer MacBooks with the USB-C port and other USB-C enabled windows laptop will support this. If youre using this with Samsung’s supported devices of DeX, once connected the “computer” version will appear on the extended display. Please check if the cable is supported using the display cable.</p>

          <h4>Design</h4>
          <p>Come in a dark space grey colour and aluminium casing around the male USB-C end and the HDMI input. Both ends are connected by a nice braided cable, around 3 inches. Simple but elegant!</p>

          <h4>Issues</h4>
          <p>If you plan to use this with an iPad with a USB-C port, be-careful as the adapter was producing under-scan(black bars around the picture on the extended monitor), however this wasn’t present during my usage with my MacBook.</p>
          <p>The adapter gets relatively warm after an hour of usage and stays warm, but it hasn’t been a problem with long usage.</p>
          <p>The monitor was having green glitches where the screen isn’t a normal colour, luckily the company reached out if everything was fine and sent out a replacement the next day. This issue didn’t reoccur on the new replacement model but it’s something to be weary about.</p>
          <p>The max support of this adapter is capped at 4K at 30Hz, which can be an issue for some.</p>

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>For its cheap price tag that you can pick it up for (under £10) and its braided cable, it makes connecting devices easier as the port has less tension if the device is elevated. This model is a slightly darker space grey(doesn’t match the MacBook colour. With its advertised lifeline warranty, you can message them and they should be able to replace the product. As currently working from home is the current standard, we would recommend getting this to connect to a larger monitor to work on.</p>
